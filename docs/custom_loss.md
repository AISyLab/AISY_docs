# Custom Loss Functions

AISY framework allows the user to set a custom loss function for the evaluated models.
When a user set a custom loss function in the main **Aisy** class, this loss function is
applied to all models that are trained by the framework. This applies to single model,
multi-model or hyperparamerer search.
